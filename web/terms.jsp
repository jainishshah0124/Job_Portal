          17. Monster's Liability</strong> <br><br>

          The  monsterindia.com and other Monster Sites act as, among other things, venues for </p>
        <ol start="1" type="1">
          <li>employers       to post job opportunities and search for and evaluate job candidates and</li>
          <li>Candidates       to post resumes and Profiles and search for and evaluate job       opportunities. Monster does not screen or censor the listings, including       Profiles offered. Monster is not involved in the actual transaction       between employers and candidates. As a result, Monster is not responsible       for User Content, the quality, safety or legality of the jobs or resumes posted,       the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of employers to offer       job opportunities to candidates or the ability of candidates to fill job       openings and Monster makes no representations about any jobs, resumes or       User Content on monsterindia.com and the other Monster Sites. While       Monster reserves the right in its sole discretion to remove User Content,       job postings, resumes or other material from the Monster Sites from time       to time, Monster does not assume any obligation to do so and to the extent       permitted by law, disclaims any liability for failing to take any such       action.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Monster  Communities provides a venue for individuals to network for professional and  personal purposes and Monster does not screen or censor the Profiles or User  Content on the Monster Sites.
